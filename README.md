## Overview
This project is an unsupervised machine learning-based customer segmentation analysis. Customer segmentation is a critical task in marketing and business strategy, helping to understand and target different customer groups effectively. In this project, we apply data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics.

## Features
List the main features and functionalities of your project.

- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features or transforming existing ones for analysis.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering): Applying clustering algorithms to group customers.
- Visualization of Customer Segments: Visualizing the results to gain insights.
- Evaluation: Assessing the quality of the segmentation.
- Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation and explanations.
